**Assumptions of ANOVA test**
Here we describe the requirement for ANOVA test. ANOVA test can be applied only when:

- The observations are obtained independently and randomly from the population defined by the factor levels
- The data of each factor level are normally distributed.
- These normal populations have a common variance. (Leveneâ€™s test can be used to check this.)
